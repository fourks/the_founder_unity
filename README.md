# The Founder
-------------

## Development Setup
In the Unity Asset Store, download and then import Unity Test Tools into
the `Assets/Imports/` folder. Make sure you don't import the `Examples`
folder.

You also need to download (and purchase if you haven't) NGUI from the Asset
Store into the `Assets/Imports/` folder. Again, don't import the `Examples`
folder.

## Important Notes

`UIPanel` depth rules:
- use 200+ for menu screens
- HUD uses 10-20
- alerts & notifications use 400+
