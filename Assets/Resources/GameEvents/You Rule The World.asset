  description: "Astra Taylor is a documentary filmmaker who has described her work
    as the \u201Csteamed broccoli\u201D in our cultural diet. Her last film, \u201CExamined
    Life,\u201D depicted philosophers walking around and talking about their ideas.
    She\u2019s the kind of creative person who was supposed to benefit when the Internet
    revolution collapsed old media hierarchies. But two decades since that revolution
    began, she\u2019s not impressed: \u201CWe are at risk of starving in the midst
    of plenty,\u201D Taylor writes. \u201CFree culture, like cheap food, incurs hidden
    costs.\u201D Instead of serving as the great equalizer, the web has created an
    abhorrent cultural feudalism. The creative masses connect, create and labor, while
    Google, Facebook and Amazon collect the cash."
