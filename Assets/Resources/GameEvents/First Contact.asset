  description: Perhaps one of the most significant events in human history has occurred
    - a <PLAYERCOMPANY> convoy made first contact with an alien civilization. "This
    feels like the discovery of the New World. We immediately sent market research
    teams to the sector in order to learn more about the aliens' consumer preferences,"
    the CEO of <AICOMPANY> remarked.  "<AICOMPANY> will be the first to corner the
    New Market."
